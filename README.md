# grunt-starter-kit
Simple starter kit to get coding quickly!

## How to get started

Open up terminal, change to the directory you want this in, and clone away.

Once it's cloned, type in:  npm install

Then type in:  grunt watch

Grunt should be watching your project now.

You can uncomment the function in js/app.js and save to see a "Hello!" message appear in index.html.  

You can also add a background color to the body in css/main.scss and save to make sure CSS is all good.
