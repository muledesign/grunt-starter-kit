# Grunt Starter Kit
Simple starter kit to get coding quickly!

## How to get started

Open up Terminal, change to the directory you want this in, and clone away.

Once it's cloned, and since this is only a starter kit, move the files to another directory where your actual project will live.  

Make sure you have [Node](https://nodejs.org) installed!

Switch over in Terminal to your new project directory and type in:  npm install

Node will download some stuff.

When it's done, type in:  grunt watch

Grunt should be watching your project for changes now.  To test, do the following:

Uncomment the function in js/app.js and save.  

Add a background color to the body in css/main.scss and save. 

If you see index.html with your new background color and "Hello!" in the body, you're good to go.
